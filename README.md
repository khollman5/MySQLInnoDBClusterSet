Simplest way to execute one-liners for a InnoDB ClusterSet config from scratch and with all defaults.. 

Install MySQL Repo and take it from there.
A single line for each step and creating an InnoDB Cluster and ClusterSet registering Routers just becomes sooo simple... 

Make it easier to use from orchestrators and frameworks that just want to execute commands and move onto the next step.
